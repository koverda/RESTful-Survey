# RESTful Survey API 

This API helps ask a 3 question survey, with an optional feedback form. 
The results are stored in serialized endpoints for retrieval. 

Based on the [Django REST framework tutorial][tut].

TODO:
1. Allow submission of surveys w/o authentication
2. Host this webapp somewhere!
