# RESTful Survey API 

This API helps ask a 3 question survey, with an optional feedback form. 
The results are stored in serialized endpoints for retrieval. 

TODO:
1. Get rid of the '---' choice for the yes/no question in the survey
2. Allow submission of surveys w/o authentication


Based on the [Django REST framework tutorial][tut].
